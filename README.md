# projectProposal  

#### Application Goal  
My application will be a virtual recipe book. The goal will be to share recipes on the application. The recipes can be categorized by type of cuisine and users can add their own recipes to the book. Each recipe will also contain other suggested recipes and links to access them.  

#### Primary Audience  
My audience will be people who love cooking and want to access a wide array of recipes. The audience will include those who want to share their own recipes with others as well or add alterations to recipes.  

##### CRUD Operations  
Users will be able to create and upload their own recipes to the application. They can also access recipe collections, view others' recipes, and read suggested recipes. Users will have the ability to edit existing recipes and can also delete outdated recipes. The updates and deletions of recipes will be approved by a moderator.  

#### Additional Feature  
I will include the additional feature of bookmarking or favoriting recipes, so that useres can easily access their favorite ones.
